CabinetMaker
============

Simple Java library to create Cabinet (CAB) files based on Microsoft's format.

I created this library after not being able to find an existing pure java implementation for creating cabinet files. Written originally to create tsk files for themes for windows mobile devices, I make no guarantees on how well it functions in general.

Made open source by request from a stack overflow thread I created when originally looking for a pure Java CAB creator. Original stack overflow thread is here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/853244/create-a-cabinet-file-in-java/1156528

Please don't judge me on the code quality, this was written in 2007 while I was still at uni and has been released in an as-is state :)
